Introduction 
Introducing the DSDM® Agile Project Framework (AgilePF) 
The DSDM Agile Project Framework is the latest version of the DSDM method, designed in such a way 
as to allow easy integration with other Agile approaches such as Scrum and Agile software engineering 
practices such as those advocated by eXtreme Programming. It also retains a key strength from 
previous versions of the method designed to allow easy adoption by larger organisations where a full 
project approach, with formal governance, is either expected or will add value. This pocket book describes a version of the DSDM Agile Project Framework tailored specifically to 
complement Scrum - the worlds most widely used team focussed Agile product development approach. It incorporates DSDM’s project-focused principles, together with DSDM’s rich set of roles and 
responsibilities that are ideally suited to a corporate project environment. It also offers the robust and 
fully Agile DSDM techniques for establishing and demonstrating control in a project. At the delivery 
level, the Agile Project Framework exploits the new simplicity of the DSDM process to work alongside 
and complement the Scrum product delivery process without the need for a change of approach. AgilePF for Scrum brings together the strength of DSDM at project level and the streamlined simplicity 
of Scrum at the delivery team level. One or more aspects of AgilePF may be used to supplement Scrum on a project-by-project basis or an 
organisation may choose to implement some or all of it as a standard. Regardless, aspects of the 
AgilePF should be used where they make the use of Scrum easier, more effective or simply make it 
more accessible to project and organisational stakeholders. Introducing DSDM 
DSDM was initially created in 1994 through collaboration of a large number of project practitioners 
across many blue chip companies who were seeking to build quality into Rapid Application 
Development (RAD). DSDM is a proven framework for agile project management and delivery, helping to deliver results 
quickly and effectively. It concentrates on strategic goals and incremental delivery of real business 
benefits while keeping control of time, cost, risk and quality. Agility is enabled through the encouragement of self-0organising, empowered teams working together 
in a supportive and collaborative manner. Since 1994, DSDM has been effectively applied to a wide 
range of projects from small software developments all the way up to full-scale business process 
change. © 2012 – 2014 DSDM Consortium

DSDM agility 
DSDM advocates that projects should do just ‘enough design up front’ within a Foundations phase in 
order to understand and clarify the structure of the overall solution and to create an agile plan for 
delivery of the project. This puts in place the foundations for successful development and delivery. It is important to understand that the Foundations phase of a DSDM project is very different to the 
Analysis and Design steps in a traditional ‘waterfall’ approach. In a DSDM project, analysis and design 
activity carried in Foundations covers the full breadth of the project but deliberately avoids going into 
detail. Substituting traditional ‘big design up front’ with DSDM’s ‘enough design up front’ promotes 
Agility in developing the required solution whilst avoiding the risk of ‘no design up front’ that makes 
many larger and more strongly governed organisations so nervous. (DSDM® and Atern® are Registered Trade Marks of Dynamic Systems Development Method Limited) 
Introducing Scrum 
Scrum takes an empirical, product-focussed approach to the delivery of products (predominantly 
software). From a process perspective it is both simple and elegant. Throughout this paper, the 
authors have tried to use terminology and definition of what Scrum is that is consistent with The Scrum 
Guide 2013 (July 2013, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, www.scrumguides.org). The Scrum Process 
 
● 
A Product Owner defines an ordered set of requirements for the product to be built. The 
Product Backlog is a dynamic artefact that evolves over time in line with the changing needs of 
the business for which the product is being built 
● 
The Scrum Team (comprising the Product Owner, the Development Team and the Scrum 
Master) use their knowledge, experience and understanding of the product and the 
requirements to agree a number of the most important items from the Product Backlog to be 
addressed in a Sprint  
● 
In the process of Sprint Planning, the Scrum Team collaborate to fully understand the backlog 
items selected for the Sprint and work out how they are going to be implemented in the Product 
Increment delivered at the end of the Sprint. The two outputs of the Sprint Planning Meeting 
are: 
o 
The Sprint Goal – which provides a succinct focus for what the Scrum Team wants to 
achieve by the end of the Sprint 
o 
The Sprint Backlog which defines, at varying levels of granularity, the work needed to 
deliver the Increment  
● 
The duration of the Sprint is agreed at the outset and does not change. Every day, the team holds 
a 15 minute Scrum meeting. The primary purpose of the Scrum is to allow the Scrum Team to 
refine their focus on the Sprint Goal, identify any impediments and agree an informal 
collaborative plan for who will be doing what in the working day up to the next Scrum

● 
The Sprint ends with a Sprint Review Meeting where the Product Increment is demonstrated 
and accepted. A Sprint Retrospective follows, in which the team reflect on the effectiveness of 
the way they worked and agree strategies for improvement where needed. ● 
A ScrumMaster is present throughout to help keep the Scrum Team focussed on their goal and 
to help them get the most out of the Scrum Events (Sprint Planning Meeting, Daily Scrum, Sprint 
Review and Retrospective) 
Scrum has a product focus rather than a project focus so more emphasis is placed on incremental 
release of a product in the context of a product lifecycle than is placed on formally ending development 
work after an agreed period of time. Effectively, development ends when the value to be delivered by 
the next Product Increment can not be justified from a business perspective. AgilePF for Scrum 
Philosophy 
The DSDM Agile Project Framework embraces the project delivery values at the heart of DSDM and 
fully aligns with the product development philosophy inherent in Scrum. The DSDM Philosophy is that best business value emerges when projects are aligned to clear business 
goals, deliver frequently and involve the collaboration of motivated and empowered people. This is best achieved when all stakeholders understand and buy into the business vision and 
objectives, are empowered to an appropriate level, and collaborate in order to deliver a fit-for-purpose 
solution.",0.41717052

What are 8 principles of DSDM,"The eight Principles are: 
1. Focus on the business need 
2. Deliver on time 
3. Collaborate 
4. Never compromise quality 
5. Build incrementally from firm foundations  
6. Develop iteratively

What are 8 principles of DSDM,"Communicate continuously and clearly 
8. Demonstrate control 
Principle 1 - Focus on the business need 
Every decision taken during a project should be viewed in the light of the overriding 
project goal - to deliver what the business needs to be delivered, when it needs to be 
delivered. It is important to remember that a project is a means to an end, not an end in 
itself. In order to fulfil this principle, project teams need to: 
● 
Understand the true business priorities 
● 
Establish a valid business case 
● 
Ensure continuous business sponsorship and commitment throughout the project 
Specific business roles (described later), in conjunction with the work completed in the Foundations 
phase, and supported by time-boxed delivery and appropriate prioritisation of requirements, enables 
teams to fulfil this principle. © 2012 – 2014 DSDM Consortium

Principle 2 - Deliver on time 
Delivering a solution on time is a very desirable outcome for a project and is quite often 
the single most important success factor. Late delivery can often undermine the very 
rationale for a project, especially where market opportunities or legal deadlines are 
involved. Even for projects without a need for a fixed end date, on time delivery of 
intermediate or contributing products is still the best way to demonstrate control over 
evolution of the solution. In order to fulfil this principle, teams need to: 
● 
Timebox the work into short delivery Sprints 
● 
Focus on business priorities 
● 
Always hit deadlines 
● 
Build confidence through predictable delivery 
Working in short focussed Sprints, typically of 2-4 weeks, and flexing the scope of what is delivered in 
that timeframe allows teams to implement this principle and build a reputation for timely and 
predictable deliveries. Incremental, timeboxed delivery of valuable solution features in short 
timeframes forms the basis for control over the longer-term delivery of the project. Principle 3 – Collaborate 
Teams that work in a spirit of active cooperation and commitment will always 
outperform groups of individuals working only in loose association.",0.299496
What are 8 principles of DSDM,"These techniques are far more effective ways of communicating than relying on large textual 
documents, which in themselves provide no financial value to the project or the business. © 2012 – 2014 DSDM Consortium

Principle 8 - Demonstrate control 
It is essential to be in control of a project at all times and to be able to demonstrate that 
this is the case. This can only be achieved by reference to a plan for the work being done, 
which is clearly aligned with agreed business objectives. It is also vital to ensure 
transparency of all work being performed by the team 
In order to fulfil this principle, the Scrum Team and the Project Manager will: 
● 
Make plans and progress visible to all 
● 
Measure progress through focus on delivery of products rather than completed activities 
● 
Manage proactively 
● 
Evaluate continuing project viability based on the business objectives 
● 
Use an appropriate level of formality for tracking and reporting 
The use of well planned incremental delivery, which incorporates incremental review and acceptance, 
based on sound but not detailed planning in the Foundations phase helps all project participants follow 
this principle. Variables 
Projects have to balance conflicting demands and the four most common demands are: time, cost, 
features and quality.",0.30090687
What is Scrum Process,"Every member of the team is 
expected to work collaboratively with everybody else, using his or her knowledge, experience and 
judgement to shape a project outcome that best meets the need of the sponsoring business. Processes 
and Tools play an important part in any project but much less emphasis is placed on these in an Agile 
environment. Agile processes need to be light touch and serve to guide and support rather than dictate 
what individuals and teams should do and how they should do it. The assumption is that the team 
themselves are best placed to understand what needs to be done and to work out the best way of doing 
it. AgilePF and Scrum provide appropriate light touch guidance, whilst keeping the emphasis at all 
times on the people and the way they work together. Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation 
The choice of words used here reflects the origins and primary focus of Agile – that it is for software 
delivery. However, changing a single word  - changing “software” to “solution” - elevates this value 
from delivery of a software product into the broader context of business change projects. The main message behind this value is to break the illusion of security and stability that comes from 
document-driven, predictive processes.",0.30938756
What is Scrum Process,"With 
the level of change that is a fact of life in the modern world, creating detailed, long-term plans becomes 
a waste of time. In this modern world, the high-level ‘light touch’ and ‘guiding’ plans as advocated by 
AgilePF for Scrum better meet the project, and ultimately the business, need. The final sentence 
AgilePF for Scrum specifically embraces the last sentence in the Manifesto that clearly states, in the 
context of the values above “That is, while there is value to the items on the right, we value the 
items on the left more.”  It is important not to shun Processes, Tools, Documentation, Contracts and 
Plans but instead to ensure that they are only created where they add value, and only to the level of 
detail that adds value. They should be created in a form relevant to and taking full advantage of the 
Agile philosophy. Principles 
The eight DSDM principles underpin AgilePF for Scrum and support the Philosophy. They bring the 
Agile Values to life by guiding the team in the attitude it must take and the mind-set it must adopt in 
order to deliver consistently whilst still remaining flexible. Compromising any principle undermines 
the basic philosophy and introduces risk to the successful outcome of the project.",0.33427623
